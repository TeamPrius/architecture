# architecture

This repository will contain a security architecture we designed for the capstone project of the Fields/Cyber Connexion cybersecurity program. In order to compile on our AWS lab environment we have split up the architecture into two parts. One contains the on premises and non-production environments. The other contains the on premises and production environments.

## architecture visualization

In the [architecture_visualization folder](https://github.com/TeamPrius/architecture/tree/main/architecture_visualization) we include the draw.io code which was used to design the architecture. In addition, we provide an image which illustrates the design.

# rough work

We include some rough work in archived repositories.
